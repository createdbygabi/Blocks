Current Hero Section:
Title: "${heroTitle}"
Subtitle: "${heroSubtitle}"
Target Audience: "${targetAudience}"
Pain Point: "${painPoint}"

Provide a quick, actionable analysis following this exact format:

QUICK ANALYSIS:
Relevance to Audience: [1 sentence, straight to the point]
Clarity: [1 sentence, straight to the point]
Action Words: [1 sentence, straight to the point]
Emotional Appeal: [1 sentence, straight to the point]
Value Proposition: [1 sentence, straight to the point]
Urgency: [1 sentence, straight to the point]
Solution Focus: [1 sentence, straight to the point]

Then provide 3 alternative headlines & subtitles that are better, based on relevance to the audience, clarity, action words, emotional appeal, value proposition, urgency, and solution focus. Here are some examples of good titles and subtitles:

Example Good Titles:
${HERO_INSTRUCTIONS.title.examples.map((ex) => `- "${ex}"`).join("\n")}

Example Good Subtitles:
${HERO_INSTRUCTIONS.subtitle.examples.map((ex) => `- "${ex}"`).join("\n")}
1. [Alternative headline]
2. [Alternative headline]
3. [Alternative headline]
4. [Alternative subtitle]
5. [Alternative subtitle]
6. [Alternative subtitle]

DO not mention AI in the analysis or recommendations.

Keep the analysis concise and actionable. Focus on specific improvements rather than scoring.`;
