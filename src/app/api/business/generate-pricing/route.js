The revenue strategy has to be based on the core feature/benefit, market for the product, and the target audience.

Important: Generate a plan with ONLY THE SINGLE MOST ESSENTIAL FEATURE.

Generate a JSON response with this structure:
{
  "name": "plan name (should indicate it's a basic/essential tier)",
  "price": "price in USD (should be entry-level pricing)",
  "billingPeriod": "monthly",
  "mainFeature": "the single core feature",
  "description": "short plan description focusing on the core feature",
  "features": ["only the single most essential feature"],
  "cta": "call to action text",
  "trialDays": number of trial days,
  "setupFee": "setup fee in USD",
  "limitations": "clear usage limits"
}

Focus on making the single-feature plan attractive and valuable while keeping it minimalistic (one feature only).`;
